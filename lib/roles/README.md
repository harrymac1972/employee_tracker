## Description
The Employee Tracker App is one that allows users to view, add, and update tables from an Employee Database.
I learned a big lesson about Node and it's asynchronicity!  I really thought this would be my easiest assignment, but it proved a huge challenge.  To really understand 'Promises' along with the 'Async / Await', etc.  This is so different to anything I'd done with Python.  I'm almost embarrassed how much time I'd spent on this assignment but I really wanted to understand it.

Also, I learned to look for libraries that can help me!  I spent hours making the 'Table.js' that just wasn't needed when I found 'cli-table'.

In conclusion, this assignment is a testament to just how stubborn I can be.
